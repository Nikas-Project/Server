# Security Policy

## Reporting Potential Security Issues

If you have encountered a potential security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us at [info@nikasproject.ir](mailto:info@nikasproject.ir). We will work with you to verify the vulnerability and patch it.

When reporting issues, please provide the following information:

-   Component(s) affected
-   A description indicating how to reproduce the issue
-   A summary of the security vulnerability and impact

We request that you contact us via the email address above and give the project contributors a chance to resolve the vulnerability and issue a new release prior to any public exposure; this helps protect the project's users, and provides them with a chance to upgrade and/or update in order to protect their applications.

## Policy

If we verify a reported security vulnerability, our policy is:

-   We will patch the current release branch, as well as the immediate prior minor release branch.
-   After patching the release branches, we will immediately issue new security fix releases for each patched release branch.
