 * Best practices by mailchimp:

 * When writing your test:
 *  - Do not add extra describe blocks. Jest tests are automatically file-scoped,
 *    so a file that performs a single test does not need a describe block in it.
 *    You may add multiple describe blocks to group related tests within one
 *    file, but you should not have a file with only a single describe block in
 *    it.
 *  - Always use test() instead of it() to define test functions.
 *  - Do not import describe, test, jest, jasmine, or expect. They are automatic
 *    globals in all test files.
 *  - Use arrow functions for all describe and test functions.
 *  - Use Jestâ€™s built-in expect function for assertions.
 *  - You might need to test asynchronous code: functions that either return a
 *    Promise or take a callback argument. You should use Promises unless you
 *    need to use a callback, such as when the API of another package requires
 *    it. When using callbacks, make sure to add a done argument to your test
 *    function and call done when all testing is complete.
